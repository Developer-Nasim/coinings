                            Earner accredits players once an order is completed. See our "Orders" section below for a definition of a completed order.

High ratings allow players to obtain advanced player levels (see Levels below). In certain cases, exceedingly low ratings may lead to the suspension of the player’s account.
                            For security concerns, Earner may temporarily disable a player’s ability to withdraw revenue to prevent fraudulent or illicit activity. This may come as a result of security issues, improper behavior reported by other users, or associating multiple Earner accounts to a single withdrawal provider.
                            players are responsible for obtaining a general liability insurance policy with coverage amounts that are sufficient to cover all risks associated with the performance of their services.
